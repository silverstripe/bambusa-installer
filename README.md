## Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/silverstripe/bambusa-installer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/silverstripe/bambusa-installer)

Demonstration project for SilverStripe CMS.

## About this project

This project is meant to demonstrate key features of SilverStripe CMS. It combines both commercially supported modules and non-supported community modules. The frontend of the Bambusa demo is built on top of the [Bambusa Theme](https://github.com/silverstripe/bambusa-theme).

This project is used to build the demonstration environment when a user request a SilverStripe demo from [silverstripe.com/demo](https://silverstripe.com/demo). 

It's not meant to be used directly by the community. However, there's nothing stopping third party from re-using it for their own demo. SilverStripe doesn't provide official support for this project.

## Custom Demos

Bambusa can serve as a great starting point for custom demos,
e.g. as part of sales pitches. It comes with great default content
that shows off CMS capabilities, and a well polished theme.

There's some parts which aren't often required in those custom demos,
so you should start by cloning the repo into a copy,
then modifying `composer.json` to your needs.
Don't forget to contribute back anything that's useful though!

For example, you might want to remove `silverstripe/bambusa-selfservice`
which is only required for self-service demos created through silverstripe.com/demo.

```
composer remove silverstripe/bambusa-selfservice
```

If you're using the default content (which includes translations),
those won't show in the CMS or frontend because they're kept in separate database tables.

## Removing Fluent

Our multilingual capabilities are important, but sometimes not required for custom demos.
Given that the underlying module (`silverstripe/fluent`) can
have side effects on other modules, it's often easiest to remove it.  

```
composer remove silverstripe/bambusa-fluent tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent
```

Note that due to the fluent table structure, you can continue to use the
default database content - any content in other languages simply won't show
to visitors or authors. The sample content itself will mention multilingual
capabilities though.

## Removing Raygun

While it's probably a good idea to be aware of any errors you're receiving
when preparing or running a demo, in case you don't want to set up a Raygun application for it,
here's how to remove it and avoid complaints about a missing `SS_RAYGUN_APP_KEY`:

```
composer remove silverstripe/raygun
```

## Local Development

### Vagrant

This project can be spun up through our
[default Vagrant setup](https://silverstripe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/401506576/Vagrant).

```
vagrant up
```

It'll be available under `http://bambusa.vagrant`.

Note that Solr search won't work out of the box unless you configure it
in the Vagrant box.

### Docker

This project is aimed to be deployed in an internal Kubernetes stack,
as a set of Docker containers. You can approximate this setup locally
by running it through [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```
cd docker
docker-compose up
```  

Once all containers have launched, you should be able to access the site
under `http://localhost:8200`.

If you need access to individual containers (e.g. SSH into the web container),
you can use `docker-compose exec` to get an interactive shell
with the webserver user:

```
docker-compose exec -u www-data web /bin/bash
``` 

## Docker Builds

WARNING: The Docker image is specifically crafted for our internal Kubernetes stack. It is not supposed to suit any other needs.

The `docker/deploy.sh` script is run on [TravisCI](../.travis.yml) on green builds after merge to master.  
It builds a new docker image and publishes it to docker hub as [silverstripe/bambusa-installer](https://hub.docker.com/r/silverstripe/bambusa-installer)

`.travis.yml` uses the following environment vars (these are supposed to be set on CI side):
  - `DOCKERHUB_USER`, which is used to log in to docker hub (e.g. silverstripe)
  - `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD`, which is used to log in to docker hub (e.g. qwerty123)
  - `DOCKERHUB_IMAGE`, which is the docker hub account+image (e.g. silverstripe/bambusa-installer)

The image includes basic PHP + Apache setup, including the application source code with installed dependencies (--prefer-dist)

The [docker/scripts](./docker/scripts) folder contains auxiliary tooling for running this image on our Kubernetes cluster
